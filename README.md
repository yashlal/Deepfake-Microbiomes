# Deepfake Microbiomes

Using artificial intelligence, specifically deep neural nets under a Wasserstein GAN styled framework, to build a model that generates synthetic “deepfakes” of human microbiome data and can be used to analyze and understand the important underlying microbial relationships in the human gut.

Despite the last commit message, the generator is still a WIP.
